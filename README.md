# Question: How do you detect if a set of parentheses, brackets, and braces are all balanced? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript console application provided uses a function called `isBalanced` to determine if a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. The function uses a stack data structure and a map to keep track of the opening brackets. The function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the function pops the last opening bracket from the stack and checks if it matches the closing bracket using the map. If the closing bracket does not match the last opening bracket, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the string is not balanced. After the iteration, if there are any remaining opening brackets left in the stack, the function also returns false. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns true, indicating that the string is balanced. The function is then tested with various string inputs using console.log statements.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution introduces a generic Stack class, which is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This class has methods for pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element off the stack, peeking at the top element of the stack, and checking if the stack is empty. This class is used in the `isBalanced` function to keep track of the opening brackets.

The TypeScript version also uses the `includes` method to check if a character is an opening or closing bracket, and the `indexOf` method to get the index of a character in the opening or closing brackets array. This is different from the JavaScript version, which uses a map to match the opening and closing brackets.

In terms of type safety, the TypeScript version is more robust. It specifies the types of the variables and the return types of the functions, which can help prevent type-related bugs. For example, the `isBalanced` function is explicitly typed to take a string as an argument and return a boolean. The Stack class is also generic, which means it can be used with any type.

Overall, the TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and type-safe than the JavaScript version, but they both solve the problem in a similar way.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. However, instead of using a map to match the opening and closing brackets, it uses a helper function `arePair` that returns true if the opening and closing brackets match and false otherwise. 

In the `areParenthesesBalanced` function, it iterates over the string, pushing any opening brackets onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the closing bracket doesn't match the last opening bracket using the `arePair` function. If either of these conditions are met, it returns false. Otherwise, it pops the last opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty after iterating over the string, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The main difference between the JavaScript and C++ versions is the use of a map in JavaScript and a helper function in C++. The C++ version also includes a main function that prompts the user to enter an expression and then prints whether the expression is balanced or not. 

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses the `std::stack` and `std::string` classes from the Standard Template Library (STL), and the `std::cin` and `std::cout` objects for input and output. The JavaScript version uses an array as a stack and a JavaScript object as a map, and it uses `console.log` for output.
